# LeetCode DSA Roadmap 🚀

This repository documents my structured journey of mastering
Data Structures and Algorithms using LeetCode.

The focus is not only on solving problems, but on:
- Building strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Understanding patterns and trade-offs
- Writing clean, readable, and optimized solutions
- Maintaining consistency and discipline

---

## 📌 Roadmap

Problems are organized by:
- **Topic** (Arrays, Hashing, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- **Difficulty** (Easy / Medium / Hard)

Each solution includes:
- Clear approach explanation
- Time and space complexity
- Clean, interview-ready code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Primary Language:** Python  
- **Platform:** LeetCode  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

A dedicated progress tracker is maintained to reflect:
- Completed problems
- Current focus areas
- Learning consistency

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> *“Don’t memorize solutions — understand patterns.”*

This repository is built as a long-term reference for
revision, interviews, and continuous improvement.
